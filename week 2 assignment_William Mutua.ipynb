    "### SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function fractional_knapsack is defined.\n",
    "2. It takes three arguments: two lists value and weight; and a number capacity.\n",
    "3. It returns (max_value, fractions) where max_value is the maximum value of items with total weight not more than capacity.\n",
    "4. fractions is a list where fractions[i] is the fraction that should be taken of item i, where 0 <= i < total number of items.\n",
    "5. The function works by choosing an item from the remaining items that has the maximum value to weight ratio.\n",
    "6. If the knapsack can include the entire weight of the item, then the full amount of the item is added to the knapsack.\n",
    "7. If not, then only a fraction of this item is added such that the knapsack becomes full.\n",
    "8. The above three steps are repeated until the knapsack becomes full, i.e. the total weight reaches the maximum weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will be prompted to enter the number of items n.\n",
    "2. You will then asked to enter n values and n weights.\n",
    "3. The function fractional_knapsack will be called to get the maxmimum value and the list of fractions.\n",
    "4. The result will then displayed.\n",
